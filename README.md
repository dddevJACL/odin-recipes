Odin Project / Foundations course / HTML foundations / Project: Recipes <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first project in the foundations course for the Odin project. After having learned basic html, the task was to create a basic html only website that has a homepage linking to three recipes.
On each respective recipe page, there is an image of the recipe, a description of the recipe, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of directions to follow. I also added a link back to the homepage for convenience sake.
